# Craft CMS 3 Starter theme

This is a starter theme for Craft CMS - it can be used as scaffolding for any project. It consists of:

* Boilerplate Twig files
* Base CSS code with Bulma framework included. Can be pretty opinionated.
* Gulp config for compiling JS and CSS assets and running browsersync
* Few useful Craft config settings
